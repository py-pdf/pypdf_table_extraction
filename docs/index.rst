**pypdf_table_extraction** Formerly known as `Camelot`_ is a Python library that can help you extract tables from PDFs!

.. _Camelot: https://github.com/camelot-dev/camelot

----

**Here's how you can extract tables from PDFs.**
You can check out the quickstart notebook.

.. image:: https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg
    :target: https://colab.research.google.com/github/py-pdf/pypdf_table_extraction/blob/main/examples/pypdf_table_extraction_quick_start_notebook.ipynb

Or follow the example below.
You can find the PDF used in this example `here`_.

.. _here: _static/pdf/foo.pdf

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> import camelot
    >>> tables = camelot.read_pdf('foo.pdf')
    >>> tables
    <TableList n=1>
    >>> tables.export('foo.csv', f='csv', compress=True) # json, excel, html, markdown, sqlite
    >>> tables[0]
    <Table shape=(7, 7)>
    >>> tables[0].parsing_report
    {
        'accuracy': 99.02,
        'whitespace': 12.24,
        'order': 1,
        'page': 1
    }
    >>> tables[0].to_csv('foo.csv') # to_json, to_excel, to_html, to_markdown, to_sqlite
    >>> tables[0].df # get a pandas DataFrame!

.. csv-table::
  :file: _static/csv/foo.csv

pypdf_table_extraction also comes packaged with a :ref:`command-line interface <cli>`!

.. note:: pypdf_table_extraction only works with text-based PDFs and not scanned documents. (As Tabula `explains`_, "If you can click and drag to select text in your table in a PDF viewer, then your PDF is text-based".)

Why pypdf_table_extraction?
---------------------------

- **Configurability**: pypdf_table_extraction gives you control over the table extraction process with :ref:`tweakable settings <advanced>`.
- **Metrics**: You can discard bad tables based on metrics like accuracy and whitespace, without having to manually look at each table.
- **Output**: Each table is extracted into a **pandas DataFrame**, which seamlessly integrates into `ETL and data analysis workflows`_. You can also export tables to multiple formats, which include CSV, JSON, Excel, HTML, Markdown, and Sqlite.
